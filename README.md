# Advanced Analytics on UAE Auto Sales & Predictive Machine Learning Model for Price Prediction
## Project Overview
The "Smart Car Valuation: Predictive Pricing Model for UAE's Used Auto Market" project aims to develop a robust machine learning model to predict the prices of used cars in the UAE. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of vehicle sales, the project provides accurate price estimates and valuable insights into market trends.

## Data Description
The dataset includes the following features: Price, Brand, Model, Trim, Kilometers, Year, Vehicle Age, Regional Specs, Doors, Body Type, Fuel Type, Seating Capacity, Transmission Type, Engine Capacity, Horsepower, No of Cylinders, Exterior Color, Interior Color, Warranty, Location details (Country, City, Area, Latitude, Longitude), Seller Type

## Methodology
### Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values and removed outliers.
Filtered data to focus on relevant years (2009-2024).
Converted categorical variables to appropriate formats.
### Exploratory Data Analysis
Conducted analysis to uncover market trends and consumer preferences.
Visualized top-selling car brands, models, and the impact of features like color, body type, and horsepower on sales.
Analyzed geographical distribution of car sales.
### Predictive Modeling
Implemented multiple regression models: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.
Conducted hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
Evaluated models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.

## Results
Developed an accurate pricing model providing significant insights into factors influencing used car prices in the UAE.
Enhanced sellers' ability to set competitive prices and improved market transparency.
